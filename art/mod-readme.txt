Thank you for downloading Funkin' Modpack Frenzy.
Before anything, it's highly recommended that you open the file called "Modpack-Disable", since it will let you choose which mods you don't want to see in-game.
In case you disable something you didn't want to, open the file called "Modpack-Enable" and choose the mods you would like to enable.
Thank you for reading, and enjoy the game.
